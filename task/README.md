# `task` folder

This folder is just an example folder where a processing task could be
invoked.  Normally here one could find:

- The JSON config. file for the processor to be executed
- The `in` subdirectory, with the input files to processor
- The `out` subdirectory, where the output files will presumably go
- The `log` subdirectory, where the log files will be saved

Any current content in this particular folder is just part of past tests.
